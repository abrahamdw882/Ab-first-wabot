# AbZtech MD  for beginners 

Just a fun little bot I remade for WhatsApp
using Baileys.  
It can send  and
do random stuff.

main of bot  (`index.js`).  

To Use Bot on pc simply download code  - then use code editor ha am funny right 
okay straight back to the topic 

simply install dependencies 
1. npm install - to install all dependencies
2. node index.js - to start bot
3. then u check ports it will give u a url some pc as soon as u use node index.js it will open local host
containing a web view that u will use to pair or scan and link to bot so i guess thats all i guess
